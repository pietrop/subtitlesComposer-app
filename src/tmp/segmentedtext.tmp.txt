This is me.
  I'm about to go scuba diving for

  the first time ever.
  I went in expecting muffled peace

  and quiet.
  I mean, one of the earliest

  documentaries on underwater life
  was literally called “The Silent

  World”.
  “They roamed deep under the

  Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and
  the Indian Ocean, in a mysterious

  realm, a silent world.”
  But as soon as I got down a few

  yards, I couldn't help but notice
  sound all around me.

  It was hard to tell what direction
  it was coming from, or how far

  away it was.
  It was coming from boats above me.

  As far as I can tell, the Earth’s
  water is not as quiet as I

  thought.
  I’ve been binging this podcast all

  about sound, and they've been
  looking into this too "From

  DeFacto Sound, you’re listening to
  Twenty Thousand Hertz: The stories

  behind the world’s most
  recognizable and interesting

  sounds.
  I’m Dallas Taylor."

  So Dallas — life underwater can be
  pretty loud, right?

  It can!
  Just listen to these toadfish—

  they oscillate their swim bladders
  to make sounds that are loud

  enough to keep houseboat residents
  in Sausalito, California up at

  night.
  Or these Barred Grunt fish, that

  make a grinding sound with the
  teeth in their gullet.

  Or these snapping shrimp — they
  produce a sound by creating tiny

  popping bubbles with their claws.
  It’s been measured at 200

  decibels.
  That’s louder than a gunshot.

  Light doesn’t penetrate very deep
  in water, so a lot of ocean life

  has evolved to use sound as its
  primary sense.

  Because water particles are more
  densely packed together than air,

  sound travels farther and faster
  in water.

  That makes it an efficient medium
  of communication at any depth or

  time of day.
  “Let's say we had 440, like the

  middle key of your piano, or
  whatever.”

  That’s John Hildebrand, he’s a
  professor at the Scripps

  Institution of Oceanography.
  He's an expert in the field of

  underwater sound and how it’s used
  by and how it affects marine

  mammals.
  “If you looked at the wavelength

  of that sound in air, that note,
  the 440 note, would be a little

  bit less than a meter long.
  In water, it's more like several

  meters long.”
  What that means is that noise

  travels about four times faster
  and farther in water than it does

  in air.
  In an experiment in 1991, sound

  emitted from Heard Island was
  picked up at 16 sites in the

  Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian
  Oceans.

  It turns out that one of the most
  common noises in the entire ocean

  that can be picked up almost
  anywhere these days, sounds like

  this: It's the sound of boats.
  Noise from ship traffic has

  doubled every decade since the
  1960s.

  “Basically, anywhere you go, the
  ambient noise in the ocean is

  dominated by anthropogenic sound.”
  “Let's say I made a measurement 30

  years ago and now if I went to the
  same place and made the same

  measurement, it would be 10 dBs or
  more higher sound level than what

  I measured when I started my
  career.

  That’s spooky.”
  That’s a huge problem for animals

  that use sound as their primary
  sense.

  Just listen to this audio of how
  noise from a passing boat totally

  drowns out dolphin communication.
  But arguably the worst culprit of

  underwater sound pollution is a
  process that sounds like this:

  This is seismic surveying.
  It’s a process that allows

  companies to locate spots on the
  ocean floor where they can drill

  for fossil fuels.
  Boats with about 30-40 airguns

  that all go off at once will move
  back and forth over large parts of

  the ocean.
  Bubbles from the horns expand and

  contract typically every 10
  seconds, creating a huge amount of

  acoustic energy that maps
  geological structures deep in the

  ocean floor.
  And it’s about as loud as a jet at

  takeoff.
  This can go on for weeks at a

  time.
  A study of seismic survey noise

  between 1999 and 2009 found that
  airgun sounds were recorded almost

  2500 miles away from the survey
  ship itself.

  At some locations, they were
  recorded on 80 percent of days for

  over a year.
  And that changes how animals

  behave.
  A study by the Institute of Marine

  Science at the University of North
  Carolina found that reef fish

  abundance decreased by 78 percent
  during seismic surveying.

  This is what the reef looked like
  before seismic surveying in the

  area.
  And this is what it looked like

  after.
  “Seismic surveying is a

  constroversial topic at the coast
  and new research is only adding to

  the conversation.
  “One of those impacted is local

  fisherman Jack Cox.
  He’s seen firsthand the impact

  seismic surveying has on fish.”
  “It does something, that — we just

  don’t catch fish.
  For animals like whales — who rely

  on complex sound communication
  systems to socialize, find food,

  and mate — that poses a huge
  problem.

  If you watch this heat map from a
  study of endangered North Atlantic

  right whales, you can see that
  shipping paths near Boston squeeze

  the whales into a tiny space where
  communication is possible — it's

  about a third of what it was
  without the ships.

  Susan Parks, a biology professor
  at Syracuse, recorded right whale

  sounds throughout the early 2000s.
  And when she compared her audio to

  some that had been recorded in
  1956, she noticed that the older

  sounds were much deeper than her
  high-pitched recordings.

  It turns out that the whales had
  started calling at higher and

  higher frequencies in order to
  hear each other over the hum of

  ship noise.
  Apart from habitat displacement

  and communication changes, there’s
  also evidence that boat noise

  simply stresses these whales out.
  After the September 11th attacks,

  researchers in Canada’s Bay of
  Fundy compared underwater noise

  levels during a period of reduced
  ship traffic to the stress-related

  hormone levels in the right whale
  population.

  They discovered a 6 decibel noise
  decrease in the bay after 9/11,

  which correlated to lower baseline
  levels of stress related hormones.

  Effects like this go all the way
  down the food chain.

  A 2017 study found that there were
  two to three times more dead

  zooplankton after after a day of
  blasts from a single airgun.

  And the larvae of krill, which
  whales rely on for food, were

  totally destroyed.
  In April 2017, Donald Trump signed

  an executive order to open
  offshore drilling in the Atlantic.

  It directed the Interior
  Department to consider allowing

  seismic exploration by 5 companies
  that had been blocked under the

  Obama administration.
  It’s getting widespread pushback

  in Congress — there’s a bipartisan
  House bill and Democrat-led Senate

  bill to ban seismic testing — but
  if those authorizations go

  through, companies could be
  conducting seismic testing in the

  Atlantic by Fall 2017.
  So… is there any good news?

  Yes, there is.
  In 2014, the International

  Maritime Organization adopted
  guidelines for reducing commercial

  ship noise levels with things like
  noise-muffling propellers and

  insulated engines — though they’re
  not mandatory yet.

  A year later, the US Navy agreed
  to limit sonar testing — which has

  been linked to whales stranding
  themselves on beaches in habitats

  near Southern California and
  Hawaii — following a lawsuit from

  environmental groups.
  And in June 2016, the National

  Oceanic and Atmospheric
  Administration laid out an Ocean

  Noise Strategy Roadmap.
  It’s the start of a 10-year plan

  to assess the human impact on
  underwater sound and the measures

  required to reduce it.
  Seismic surveys can work better,

  too.
  Norway has started multi-client

  surveys, so that seismic data from
  a particular area is only

  collected once.
  US authorities are considering a

  similar process.
  The ocean is huge.

  We’ve explored less than 5 percent
  of it so far.

  So it’s easy to forget that what
  we do on the surface affects

  everything down below.
  But like plastic, chemicals, and

  waste, noise pollutes our oceans.
  Understanding that is key to doing

  our part to protect it.
